# hybrid-recommender-system


This project used the [MovieLens 10M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/) dataset to create a hybrid recommender system that uses TF-IDF and SVD techniques to provide movie recommendations.

A non-personalised recommender system was also created for comparison.

A very very simple command line interface was also built.

See the [paper](./Report.pdf) I wrote for more details.
